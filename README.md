anonymous_github now has the problem "The requested file is not found." According to anonymous_github's official Report an issue page, it may be a cache problem. 
Some users pointed out in the post that it can be accessed normally in incognito mode. 
In addition, I found that changing the browser or waiting for a while and then refreshing can access it normally.
